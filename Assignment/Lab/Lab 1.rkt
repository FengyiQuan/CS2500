;to make the circle grow and shrink in a loop instead of grow and suddenly dissapear and grow again
;;;Use cond (or if if youâ€™re feeling cheeky) to make the circle grow and shrink in a loop instead of grow
;and suddenly dissapear and grow again. Since computing the radius is now a somewhat complex computation,
;it makes sense to write a seperate helper function which only computes the radius that scene calls. Hint: quotient, even?.
